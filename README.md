# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Regression-Tensorflow

In this project, we will build a neural network model to solve a regression problem. We will accomplish this with the help of following tasks in the project:

-Understand the problem statement

-Understand the dataset

-Data normalization

-Train and Test split

-Create a neural network model

-Train the model to fit the dataset

-Evaluate the model

-Visualize the predictions

# Requirements

These are the libraries that we are going to use :

- Tensorflow '2.3.0'
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib
